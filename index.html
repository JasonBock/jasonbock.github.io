    Yes...I finally got my web site back up and running (a big part of it was to get my BlueSky account name to be my domain, which required me bringing it back to life and adding a <code>TXT</code> DNS entry). Well...that's a bit of a stretch - it has no content other than this home page, but it's a start. I don't know if I'm going to make any effort at bringing in any material from the 20ish years I ran the site on OrcsWeb (which got bought by SherWeb and, one day, out of nowhere, decided to shut down my site). Nor do I know if I'm going to put a lot of time adding new content. For now, this page will suffice.

<h1>Bio</h1>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>
    I grew up in a very small town called Oostburg, which is located about an hour north of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I went to college at Marquette University, getting a bachelor's and a master's degree in electrical engineering. I've been a software developer in varying roles ever since I finished college.
</p>
<p>
    I've been married to Elizabeth since September 1997. In November 2000, we made the decision to move to Minnesota, and we eventually bought a house in Shakopee, which is where we've been since 2001. We have two sons, Hayden and Ryan.
</p>
<p>
    I have a number of hobbies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Music - I've played an instrument since I was 11 (more or less). My mainstay is guitar, but I also play bass guitar, drums, and keyboards.</li>
    <li>Reading - I've always loved just sitting around and reading a book. I have <b>way</b> too many books to read these days - my eventual goal is to donate them to libraries.</li>
    <li>Coding - It's my day job, but it's also something I like to do off-hours. It's a form of puzzle solving, and it's a way to keep my brain active.</li>
    <li>Streaming - I have a YouTube channel (link is below), and I've created a bunch of coding videos over the years. Recently I've started to stream some coding sessions and video games that I enjoy. Feel free to subscribe!</li>
    <li>Self-defense - I started doing kempo karate in 2020 with my older son, who has been doing it longer than me and was always bugging me to give it a try. I'm currently a 3rd degree brown belt. The dojo I go to is <a href="https://zendragonmartialarts.com/">Zen Dragon Martial Arts</a>.</li>
</ul>
